- Minor Change: New API GET /api/ui/route/error all intermediate errors of the routes can be queried, once queried these are deleted in the backend (only cached until GET API called)

### Major Change: Infomodel Maintenance
- Major Change: Upgraded infomodel-java-artifacts 4.0.2 -> 4.0.6

- Minor Change: New API PUT /resource/contract/update to create the contract in the configmanager and update it at the dataspace connector
- Minor Change: New setting option to address the DSC via HTTP or HTTPS. dataspace.communication.ssl=true/false in application.properties and DATASPACE_COMMUNICATION_SSL=true/false in docker-compose environment.
- Minor Change: The CM now tries to reach the connector several times during startup, with a pause of 5 seconds each time, instead of just try once. The number of tries can be set individually via application.properties or docker-compose e.g. dataspace.connector.connectionattemps=5.

### Changes
